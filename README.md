# Pushups

Let's try a custom problem.
PushUps: The world record for the number of pushups in one year is 1,500,230 set in 1988 by Patty Doyle of Britain. Joe would like to break that record but he doesn't want to hurt himself. His plan is to start today by doing 3 sets of 1 rep each and then increase his repetitions by 1 each day. So tomorrow he will do 6, the next day he will do 9 and so on. In order to know when he should start his official recording he wants to know what day he will need to start his year of recording. Today is Day 1.

Bonus Challenge: Joe might can be convinced to change the number of sets and increase in reps per day so make the function sets and reps variable.

Bonus Bonus Challenge: Don't use a loop.

Good luck!
